== Lab

Create simple service that consist of a publisher - a user location _producer_ simulator.

The events sent should contain `timestamp`, `user`, `coordinates` (lat and long).

A processor app (consumer) should detect when a user escaped a predefined area and send a notification on another `topic`.
